I am a software engineer, ethical hacker and co-founder of [Vidoc Security Lab](https://www.vidocsecurity.com). Born and raised in a small village in Poland.

I spent my early teens on building processors and computers in Minecraft.

Became a professional software engineer at the age of 18. I have worked with a variety of technologies, from low-level programming to web development.

I transitioned from software engineering to security, where I have been working for the past 5 years. I play CTFs with [P4](https://ctftime.org/team/5152/) and used to be TOP1 ethical hacker in Poland.

I am obsessed with climbing and coffee.

# Startup

Lately, I have been working on a startup called [Vidoc Security Lab](https://www.vidocsecurity.com). We are building automated security code review process. It is my day and night project.
