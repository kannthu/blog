If you are reading this you probably made the mistake of creating your own [DSL (Domain specific language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language).

You thought it is a good idea to make your users learn new syntax just to use your product. I am not judging, I did the same.

This blog is a summary of my efforts to unfuck the experience for my users. You can flatten the learning curve of DSL by introducing some **technical debt**. It is not a solution, it is a tradeof.

It was built using:
- [`@monaco-editor/react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@monaco-editor/react)
- [monaco-editor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/monaco-editor)
- React

If you hate technical debt and hacky solutions, do not read it.

Note - it does not really work for mobile.

I won't give you copy-paste solution, my code sucks. I will show you what is possible with a little bit of work. I will set the bar for you.

You ove your users a decent experience, experience that does not require having a PHD in your DSL. Users do not want to learn and remember your syntax, they want to get the job done.

# Examples

Monaco editor can be rendered as a single input element, without sacrificing any of its features. It can be used for inline editing, with syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, and validation.

# How it works technically

The big problem is that we do not want to write LSP (Language Server) for our DSL. We want to deliver **decent experience, fast**.

The solution is to use expression evaluator for your DSL that will try evaluating the expression with stubs and return errors if something is wrong. You can even implement type checks for my DSL! In my case the evaluator is written in Go and I had to compile it to Javascript using [gopherjs](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs). So it is better to have it in JS or TS.

## Pseudo code
Each time user changes the input, we evaluate the expression and display the errors as markers in the editor. **It is not a LSP, but for this case it approximates the experience**.

```javascript
const expr = `contains(BasePath, "foo") == true`;

const stubVariables = {
  // variable name corresponds to its type
  BasePath: "string",
  RootURL: "string",
  Hostname: "string",
  Time: "number",
  // ...
}

const stubFunctions = {
  md5: validate("md5", ["string"], "string"),
  sha256: validate("sha256", ["string"], "string"),
  sha1: validate("sha1", ["string"], "string"),
  mmh3: validate("mmh3", ["string"], "string"),
  contains: validate("contains", ["string", "string"], true),
};

const errors = evaluateExpression(
  expr,
  {
    ...stubVariables,
    ...stubFunctions
  }
);
```

`validate` is higher order function that returns a function that will validate the arguments and return the result.

# Making Monaco Editor behave as in-line input

My code is not limited to single line inputs, it can be extended to multi-line inputs as well.

Caveats:
- It does not really work for mobile

```

{/* # Technical debt

For me it was:

- Compiling expression evaluator written in Go to Javascript (automatically!!) using [gopherjs](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs)
- Ducttaping my own shitty LSP
- Making the Monaco Editor behave as in-line input
- Making it all work in input
- Making it work for multiple instances of inputs */}
