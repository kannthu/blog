If you are reading this you probably made the mistake of creating your own [DLS (Domain specific language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language).

You thought it is a good idea to make your users learn new syntax just to use your product. I am not judging, I did the same.

This blog is a summary of my efforts to unfuck the experience for my users. You can flatten the learning curve of DSL by introducing some **technical debt**. It is not a solution, it is a tradeof.

It was built using:
- [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/)
- React

I won't give you copy-paste solution, my code sucks. I will show you what is possible with a little bit of work. I will set the bar for you.

You ove your users a decent experience, experience that does not require having a PHD in your DSL. Users do not want to learn and remember your syntax, they want to get the job done.

# Examples

Monaco editor can be rendered as a single input element, without sacrificing any of its features. It can be used for inline editing, with syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, and validation.

# Technical debt

For me it was:

- Compiling expression evaluator written in Go to Javascript (automatically!!) using [gopherjs](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs)
- Ducttaping my own shitty LSP
- Making the Monaco Editor behave as in-line input
- Making it all work in input
- Making it work for multiple instances of inputs

Following our [Series B last December](/2020/next-for-vercel), I'm happy to announce we've raised a [**$102M Series C**](https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/vercel-raises-102m-series-c-for-its-next-js-based-front-end-development-platform) from existing and new investors.

Our vision of the Web is a global realtime medium for both creators and consumers,
where all friction and latency are eliminated.
