If you are reading this you probably made the mistake of creating your own [DLS (Domain specific language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language).

You thought it is a good idea to make your users learn new syntax just to use your product. I am not judging, I did the same.

This blog is a summary of my efforts to unfuck the experience for my users. It is not a solution, it is a tradeof. You can flatten the learning curve of DSL by introducing some **technical debt**.

# What you can expect

<div className="flex mt-3 mb-7 bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-100 via-pink-100 to-blue-50 rounded-lg justify-center align-middle items-center w-full h-52">
  <div className="w-full max-w-[550px]">
    <p className="mb-1 dark:text-gray-800 text-sm font-medium">Simple input?</p>
    <EditorSmallInput
      value=""
      languageId="typescript"
      placeholder="wow, this even supports placeholder?!"
    />
  </div>
</div>

I won't give you copy-paste solution, my code sucks.

So, you are building your groudbreaking, world changing project for technical people.
You though it would be good idea to create your own DSL (Domain specific language) for your product.

When you invent your own shitty DSL (Domain specific language) for your product, have a little bit of compasion for your users and implement input with with suggestions, completions and references

User's do not want to learn and remember your syntax, they want to get the job done.

//1. Example of your own DSL - vidoc modules
//2. Example of other langs
//3. Example of creating tables with this input

Following our [Series B last December](/2020/next-for-vercel), I'm happy to announce we've raised a [**$102M Series C**](https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/vercel-raises-102m-series-c-for-its-next-js-based-front-end-development-platform) from existing and new investors.

Our vision of the Web is a global realtime medium for both creators and consumers,
where all friction and latency are eliminated.
